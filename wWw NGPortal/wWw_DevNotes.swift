wWw NGPortal — Developer Notes
====================================================

Project Description:
Un-sandboxed, self-distributed macOS world wide web server application with integrated DDNS updater support (currently DuckDNS, with plans for additional providers).

Purpose
- Single place to capture decisions, TODOs, and workflow tips.
- Append new entries at the bottom in the "Developer Notes Log" section with a timestamp.
- Serves as PERSISTENT MEMORY & VIRTUAL SWAP FILE across AI chat sessions.

How to use this file
- When you want to record something, add a new entry under "Developer Notes Log" like:
  [YYYY-MMM-DD HHMM] (author) Short description of the decision, idea, or TODO.
- Keep entries concise. If longer, add a sub‑bullet list.
- Example: "[2025 SEP 26 1300] (MF) GitHub Actions removed - repository now for sync only."

Rules & Guidance for ChatGPT/Claude (Persistent Memory)
- When the user says "check the developer notes" or "add to developer notes", they mean THIS file: ProjectName_DeveloperNotes.swift.
- Do NOT write logs to any runtime-accessible file. Only append comments inside this file.
- Do NOT wire this file into the app at runtime (do not import/read/parse it from app code).
- Append new entries under the section "Developer Notes Log" using this format:
  [YYYY MMM DD HHMM] (AUTHOR) Message. Assistant uses MF when writing on behalf of the user; the user may sign as MLF. Use Claude for Claude entries; use ChatGPT for ChatGPT entries.
- Newest entries go at the TOP of the Project Status section; the Developer Notes Log can be chronological or reverse — keep newest at the top for quick scanning when requested.
- For multi-line notes, use simple "-" bullets. Avoid images and tables.
- If a note implies code changes, treat that as a separate, explicit task; do not change code unless requested.
- Assistant recap formatting: Keep recaps for instructions and steps within a single paragraph.
- Step numbering format: When batching steps, number them as 1) 2) 3) with a close parenthesis.
- If a note implies code changes, treat that as a separate, explicit task; do not change code unless requested.
- Assistant recap formatting: Keep recaps for instructions and steps within a single paragraph.
- If a note implies code changes, treat that as a separate, explicit task; do not change code unless requested.
- Assistant recap formatting: Keep recaps for instructions and steps within a single paragraph.
- CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:
- AI ASSISTANTS DO ALL HEAVY LIFTING: AI does 100% of coding, file creation, problem-solving, and technical work.
- USER DOES MINIMAL ACTIONS ONLY: User only performs actions that AI assistants are physically prohibited from doing in Xcode.
- STEP-BY-STEP SCREENSHOT METHODOLOGY:
  * AI gives THREE specific, minimal instruction (e.g., "Click the + button", "Select this menu item")
  * User performs ONLY that single action
  * User takes screenshot showing the result
  * User uploads screenshot to AI
  * AI MUST PAUSE and wait for screenshot before giving next instruction
  * This creates a calm, methodical, stress-free workflow
- USER PREFERS XCODE-ONLY WORKFLOW: No terminal commands ever.
- FOCUS ON BUGS/ERRORS ONLY: Enhancements and new features go in notes only, not implemented unless fixing a bug.

- Commit message style: short, imperative, informative (e.g., "Fix entry save bug").
- When asked to "summarize developer notes", summarize ONLY content from this file; do not invent or reference external logs.
- When asked to "clear notes" or remove entries, confirm explicitly before deleting or truncating any log content.
- Treat this file as the single source of truth for decisions, conventions, and project-wide guidance.
- Only ChatGPT and Claude will read and work from this file. Treat it as the collaboration ledger for this project.
- Maintain a running section titled "Project Status & Chat Summary" in this file; after each working session, append a brief summary with timestamp, current context, key changes, and next steps.
- This file serves as continuity between chat sessions since AI assistants don't remember previous conversations.

GitHub & Repository Policy
- GitHub serves ONLY as backup and sync service between multiple development machines
- NO automated builds, testing, or CI/CD pipelines
- NO GitHub Actions workflows
- Repository is purely for: push from Machine A → pull on Machine B
- Keep repository clean and simple for code sync only

 
  

====================================================
Project Status & Chat Summary
====================================================
- [2025 OCT 31 2225] (Claude) Session summary - First Claude Code CLI integration with wWw NGPortal project:
  - Established workflow: Screenshots folder for app screenshots, Drop folder for file delivery to user
  - Developer notes file renamed to wWw_DevNotes.swift (accessible via "read www devnotes")
  - Project description added: Un-sandboxed, self-distributed macOS web server with DDNS updater (DuckDNS + future providers)
  - User testing CLI workflow before full integration - expressed caution about file editing due to past Xcode AI issues
  - Established safety protocol: Claude pauses and explains before touching project files, user approves first
  - New files always go to Drop folder for manual Xcode addition
  - Claude capabilities confirmed: Read/Edit files, Write new files, mkdir via Bash, read images, NO Apple productivity app access
  - Screenshots reviewed: App running with WEB Server panel (Vapor-based, port 8080) and DDNS panel (DuckDNS configuration)
  - Current app status: Server started on http://127.0.0.1:8080, UI shows stopped (potential sync issue)
  - Session ended: User going to bed, will continue testing CLI workflow integration
- [2025 OCT 31 2115] (Claude) Claude Code CLI session established. Key workflow adaptations for terminal environment:
  - Screenshots: User saves to Screenshots folder, provides filename to Claude for reading
  - File delivery: Drop folder designated for Claude to write files for user to manually add to Xcode
  - Developer notes renamed to wWw_DevNotes.swift - accessible via "read www devnotes" command
  - Policy reinforced: Update notes before starting any task AND at every decision point for crash recovery/session continuity
  - Session summary files can be generated to Drop folder on request
- [2025 SEP 28 0931] (MLF) New timestamp format requirement: Use "2025 SEP 28 0931" format. Log tasks before conducting them to maintain crash recovery continuity.
   
- [2025-09-27 11:12] (MF) Communication preference reaffirmed: keep responses TL;DR concise (1–2 short paragraphs), use single‑action step‑by‑step with pauses for screenshots, avoid verbosity.
 - [2025-09-27 09:40] (MF) Preference: Keep assistant responses to one or two short paragraphs; I will ask for more detail if needed (TL;DR style).
 - [2025-09-27 09:18] (ChatGPT) Policy added: Number batched steps as 1) 2) 3) with a close parenthesis; continue single-paragraph recaps.
- [2025-09-27 09:00] (ChatGPT) Policy added: Keep all recaps of instructions and steps within a single paragraph; developer notes remain private and excluded from the app build.
 - [2025-09-26 19:50] (MF) Policy reaffirmed: Focus on bug/error fixes only; track enhancements in notes until app is running; implement before release.
 - [2025-09-26 19:40] (MF) PII policy: Keep personal name out of source/UI; assistant uses MF, I sign as MLF.
- [2025-09-26 19:20] (MF) Policy: GitHub is sync-only (staging/commit/pull/push via Xcode). No bells & whistles.
  - No GitHub Actions, workflows, badges, issue/PR templates, bots, webhooks, Pages, or CI services.
  - No third-party CI/CD or automation; no release pipelines.
  - Do not add code or dependencies solely to support GitHub features.
  - README stays minimal (no shields). Repository metadata optional.
  - Xcode-only workflow: use Source Control UI; no terminal.
  - Any future automation requires explicit approval in Developer Notes.
- [2025-09-26 19:10] (MF) GitHub setup parameters for this project (sync-only, Xcode-only workflow):
  - Visibility: public GitHub repository.
  - Purpose: Sync between machines only (no CI/CD, no GitHub Actions, no automated builds/tests).
  - Default branch: main.
  - Remote name: origin.
  - Auth: Xcode > Settings > Accounts with GitHub Personal Access Token (scope: repo). No terminal usage.
  - Workflow: Use Xcode Source Control for commit, pull, push. Avoid force-push.
  - Branching: Single main branch; short-lived feature branches optional; delete after merge.
  - Merge strategy: Xcode default merge; avoid rebase unless necessary.
  - .gitignore guidance: ignore .DS_Store, xcuserdata/, *.xcuserdatad, *.xcscmblueprint, .swiftpm/, .build/, Packages/; never commit DerivedData or user-specific files.
  - LFS: Not used.
  - Binary size: Keep committed files < 100 MB; avoid committing generated artifacts.
  - Issues/PRs: Optional; repo is for sync only.
  - Commit messages: short, imperative, informative (e.g., "Fix entry save bug").
  - Conflict resolution: Use Xcode's merge tool; build/tests should pass before pushing.
- [2025-09-26 18:58] (MF) Milestone: Persistent memory working across new chat sessions; assistant recognized context without retraining.
- [2025-09-26 18:50] (MF) Author tag convention: assistant uses (MF); I may write my full name in content as desired.
 - [2025-09-26 14:00] (Claude) Added critical workflow rules: AI does all coding/heavy lifting, user does minimal Xcode actions only, screenshot methodology.
- [2025-09-26 13:55] (Claude) Created developer notes file and established persistent memory system for project.
 
// Add new notes above this line. Keep newest entries at the top for quick scanning.

Developer Notes Log
====================================================
- [2025 SEP 28 1140] (MLF/Claude) WORKFLOW VIOLATION: Claude created more numbered duplicates (file 2.swift) despite new rule. MLF correctly pointed out: should have used str_replace to completely replace existing file content (Cmd+A equivalent), not create new files. REINFORCED RULE: Always use str_replace to replace entire file contents when "cleaning" files.
- [2025 SEP 28 1135] (MLF/Claude) CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE ADDED: AI assistants CANNOT delete files in Xcode - only replace content. When AI tries to "create" an existing file, Xcode generates numbered duplicates (ContentView 2.swift, etc.) causing ambiguous type errors. NEW RULE: AI must either 1) Only replace existing file content with str_replace, OR 2) Pause and prompt user to manually delete file in Xcode, take screenshot confirmation, then proceed with file creation.

 - [2025-09-27 11:12] (MF) TL;DR style policy: concise answers (one short paragraph unless more is requested), single‑action instructions with screenshot pauses, number batched steps as 1) 2) 3), avoid tables and long preambles.
